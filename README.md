# 📈 Financial Tracker

The main idea behind the project is to help manage budget with free and open-source software. 
At first the application will be based fully in terminal (for testing purposes and stuff). 
In the later versions I plan to convert it to a gui app and finnaly I want to turn it into a web application.
I believe it would be easiest to take care of budget while having it available from every device. 

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **V1.0 (terminal)**
    - CSV file import and export

## 👌 About Me
Hi! I'm a second year cybersecurity student at Wrocław University of Technology.
Last year I became interested in investing but, as anybody should, I am not happy with sharing my data with big tech companies (so other application were off the tabel).
Therefore I decided to create a small tracker application to help me manage my investemenst and, as I am a student, I decided to start with personal budget management.
