# 📈 Financial Tracker
The primary objective of this project is to facilitate budget management using free and open-source software. Initially, the application will be entirely based in the terminal for testing purposes. In subsequent versions, I intend to create a user-friendly GUI and ultimately develop a web application. My belief is that having access to the application from any device will make it simpler to manage one's budget effectively.


## ▶️ Current state
Currently, the 'Budget' section of the app is nearing completion, with room for minor adjustments in the future. However, graphs are currently unavailable, but rest assured, I am actively working towards implementing this feature in the near future. My objective is to promptly address any minor issues that may arise on a daily basis and release new versions of the app as frequently as possible, ensuring a seamless user experience.


## How to run:
1. ``` py -m venv venv ```
2. ``` .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 ```
3. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Run main.py


## 👌 About Me
Hello there! I'm currently a second-year cybersecurity student at Wrocław University of Technology.
Recently, I became intrigued by the world of investing, but like many people, I am wary of entrusting my data to large tech companies (which ruled out other investment tracking applications). As a result, I took it upon myself to create a small-scale tracker application to assist with managing my investments. Given that I'm still a student, I opted to begin with personal budget management.
