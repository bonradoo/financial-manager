# 📈 Financial Tracker
The primary objective of this project is to facilitate budget management using free and open-source software. Initially, the application will be entirely based in the terminal for testing purposes. In subsequent versions, I intend to create a user-friendly GUI and ultimately develop a web application. My belief is that having access to the application from any device will make it simpler to manage one's budget effectively.


## ▶️ Current state
At present, the 'Budget' section of the app is complete and functional, though some adjustments may be made in the future. My aim is to promptly address any minor issues that arise on a daily basis and release new versions of the app as frequently as possible.


## How to run (Windows):
1. ``` py -m venv venv ```
2. ``` .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 ```
3. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Run main_gui.py


## 👌 About Me
Hello there! I'm currently a second-year cybersecurity student at Wrocław University of Technology.
Recently, I became intrigued by the world of investing, but like many people, I am wary of entrusting my data to large tech companies (which ruled out other investment tracking applications). As a result, I took it upon myself to create a small-scale tracker application to assist with managing my investments. Given that I'm still a student, I opted to begin with personal budget management.
