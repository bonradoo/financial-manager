# ðŸ“ˆ Financial Tracker
The primary objective of this project is to facilitate budget management using free and open-source software. Initially, the application will be entirely based in the terminal for testing purposes. In subsequent versions, I intend to create a user-friendly GUI and ultimately develop a web application. My belief is that having access to the application from any device will make it simpler to manage one's budget effectively.

## ðŸ‘Œ About Me
Hello there! I'm currently a second-year cybersecurity student at WrocÅ‚aw University of Technology.
Recently, I became intrigued by the world of investing, but like many people, I am wary of entrusting my data to large tech companies (which ruled out other investment tracking applications). As a result, I took it upon myself to create a small-scale tracker application to assist with managing my investments. Given that I'm still a student, I opted to begin with personal budget management.
